Loop Invariant, containing initialization and maintenance.

\part{b}\\
At the start of each iteration of the for loop in line 2, the sub array $A[1...k-1]$ consists of the elements originally in $A[1...k-1]$ but in sorted order.\\
Then: \\
Initialization – This is true, when we start j= 2,A[1..1]is just one single number, which we consider as sorted.\\
Maintenance – If $A[1..j-2]$ is sorted before, the current iteration will cause $A[1..j-1]$ to be sorted.\\
Termination – When $j=A.length$ after the termination, We will have $A[1..A.length]$ in a sorted order.\\
So, the invariant is true. Hence, after the algorithm terminates, this will leave the array A sorted.

\part{c}\\
At the start of each iteration, sub array $A[1...k]$ is sorted ans elements in $A[k+1...A.length]$ has the greater or equal value to any element in $A[1...k]$.//
Initialization - For i = 1, the invariant is true as there is one element. Which means it is sorted.\\
Maintenance - The sub array $A[1...j-1]$ is sorted, this mean when we insert the value j which is the smallest number compare with other remaining unsorted element $A[j....A.length]$. As previously computed $A[1...j-1]$ contain only the sorted element which is smaller than the value in $A[j...A.length]$. This means A[1...j] is sorted which means the invariant is preserved.\\
Termination - A[1...A.length-1] is sorted and both $A[A.length-1, A.length]$ are both larger than elements in $A[1...A.length-1]$. This means array A[1...A.length] is sorted.

$S(n) \leq n^{c+1}$\\
$S(n) \leq tn^{c+1}$\\
$t = 1, \forall n \geq n_{0} = 1$

\part{b}\\
$S(n) = 1^c + 2^c + 3^c + ... + n^c \geq (\frac{n}{2})^c + (\frac{n}{2})^c + (\frac{n}{2})^c + ... + (\frac{n}{2})^c, \forall n \geq 1$\\
$S(n) \geq (\frac{n}{2})^{c+1}, \forall n \geq 1$\\

\question{5}{problem 5}
\part{a}\\
Search the index of the val which is inserted into the function. The variable at first are "val", "m", "alist", "left", "right" and "length". Where "left" and "right" is for the index, the "length" is to make sure that the range is not greater than length-1. The "val", "m", and "alist" is the inserted value. The first while loop (from line 4 - 8) is use to find the range of index that containing "val". For line 4, the loop will run until "left" is out of the array range or when the value is greater than the "val" we are searching for. Both condition means that the function will surely terminate and return -1 as the "val" is not in an array. This condition work because we assume that the array is sorted in an increasing order. For line 5 we wanted to find the value for the variable "right". For line number 6 we check if the value on "alist[left]" is less than or equal to the "val" and "alist[right]" is greater than or equal to the "val". This is because the elem in the array is sorted from small to large, which means in most of the cases the the "left" index need to be smaller than the "right". The only cases where it is possible for "left" to be equal to "right" is when the first elem has the same value as "val" or that it is greater than "val". For line number 7, if we got the range the program will break and skip to line number 9. Else, the program will increase the value of "left" which in turn increase the value of right. This means it shifted the range to find the correct one as the value "alist[right]" in the previous range is smaller the the "val". Then the loop continues. After the loop is finish, the program goes to line number 9. This check if "left" is greater or equal to length or "alist[left]" greater than "val" it will return -1. This is because if "left" is greater or equal to the length, the value is smaller and does not exist in an array. As the index goes from 0 to length-1. For the other condition it means if the "alist[left]" is greater than the "val" the "val does not exist in the array". This is because the "alist[left]" is the smallest possible value. Some time the "right" value can be greater than lenght-1. The line number 11 is to make sure that the largest possible value for "right" is length-1. Then we start searching for the value. So we start the searching at index "i" which is equal to "left". The if condition is there to return the correct index instantly if "i" is equal to "val". However if the "val" is within the range but there is no "val" in the array it will return -1 when the loop is finish.
